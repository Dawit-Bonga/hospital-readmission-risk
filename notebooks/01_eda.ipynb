    "\n",
    "The positive class (30-day readmission) represents approximately **11%** of the dataset, while the negative class (no readmission or readmission after 30 days) accounts for over **88%**. This indicates a **strong class imbalance**, with readmissions being relatively rare events.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implications for Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to this imbalance, **accuracy alone is not a meaningful evaluation metric**, as a model could achieve high accuracy by always predicting no readmission. Instead, evaluation should focus on metrics that better capture performance on the minority class, such as **recall**, **precision**, **ROC-AUC**, and **precision–recall curves**. In this clinical context, prioritizing **recall** is especially important to minimize missed high-risk patients.\n"
